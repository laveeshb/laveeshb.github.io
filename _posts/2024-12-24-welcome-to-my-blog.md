Welcome to my blog! After years of building distributed systems and cloud infrastructure, I've finally set up a space to share thoughts, learnings, and the occasional deep dive into technical topics.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Distributed Systems** — Lessons learned from building systems at scale
- **Azure & Cloud Architecture** — Patterns, anti-patterns, and war stories
- **AI Infrastructure** — How AI is changing the way we build software
- **Open Source** — Projects I'm working on and contributions to the community

## Why Now?

After a decade at Microsoft working on Azure Resource Manager and Logic Apps, I've accumulated a lot of knowledge that might be useful to others. Writing helps me think more clearly, and hopefully some of these posts will help someone else avoid the pitfalls I've encountered.

## Stay Tuned

I'll try to post regularly. No promises on frequency, but I'll aim for quality over quantity.

If you have topics you'd like me to cover, feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laveeshbansal) or [GitHub](https://github.com/laveeshb).

Thanks for reading!
