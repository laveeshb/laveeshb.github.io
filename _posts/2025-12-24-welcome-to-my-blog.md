Welcome to my blog! After years of building distributed systems and cloud infrastructure, I've finally set up a space to share thoughts, learnings, and the occasional deep dive into technical topics.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Distributed Systems** — Lessons learned from building systems at scale
- **Azure & Cloud Architecture** — Patterns, anti-patterns, and war stories
- **AI Infrastructure** — How AI is changing the way we build software
- **Open Source** — Projects I'm working on and contributions to the community

## Why Now?

After spending years building cloud infrastructure, I figured it might be worth writing down some of the things I've learned along the way. Writing helps me think more clearly, and maybe some of these posts will help someone else avoid the same mistakes I've made.

## Stay Tuned

I'll try to post regularly. No promises on frequency, but I'll aim for quality over quantity.

Thanks for reading!
