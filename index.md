        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>I spend my days designing distributed systems that (hopefully) don't fall over at scale. Currently focused on Azure Logic Apps and AI platform at Microsoft, where I've been solving cloud infrastructure puzzles for over a decade.</p>
            <p>Before Logic Apps, I worked on Azure Resource Manager — the layer that handles every deployment you've ever clicked "Create" on in Azure. These days, I'm more interested in how AI is reshaping cloud infrastructure.</p>
            <p>When I'm not debugging production or arguing about system design, I tinker with open source projects — mostly around Azure extensibility and local-first AI assistants.</p>
            <p>I studied at UT Dallas and NIT Trichy back when "cloud" still mostly meant weather.</p>
            <p>Based in Seattle. Opinions are my own.</p>
